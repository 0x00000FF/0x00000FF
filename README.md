Hi, My name is Kangjun! You can call me K if you want.

I was born in 1997, I like to do several interesting things.

#### Languages

##### Using/Usable
한국어(Native), English(Intermediate), 日本語(初級),

* Specialty: Development on .NET and PHP Infrastructures
* Frameworks: .NET (+ ASP.NET, Entity Framework), Bootstrap, CodeIgniter
* Uses LaTeX for formatted writing

#### Interests
* **Application that is Secured, Super fast to construct, and Easy to maintain**

  Software development is always complex, and troublesome work. How can we design & construct secure application really fast?

* **Fast and Efficient End-to-End Encryption (E2EE)**
  
  How can I protect my data from peeping toms in fast, and the most efficient way?
* **Mitigation in Web Applications**

  Modern web technology relies on many of base systems and they make the entire system highly vulnerable and create a lot of attack surfaces. How can we mitigate them and eliminate the vulnerabilities?
* **Vulnerability Research & Exploitations**

  Every system have at least one vulnerabilities; Find it and weaponize, or neutralize it as soon as possible.
* **RISC Architectures(Especially ARM and RISC-V)**

  Such RISC architectures are quite interesting compared to x86-64. I want to know deep side of them.
